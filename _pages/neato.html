<p>After discovering that Neato robot vacuum cleaners have fully functioning scanning LIDAR sensors and an available USB
    interface for getting all of that data, I wrote up some ROS drivers for it, hooked it up to some localization and
    mapping packages, and tweaked them for the robot's dimensions. Essentially, I've got a <a
        href="http://turtlebot.com">TurtleBot</a>. Maybe its turning isn't <i>quite</i> as precise, but it also doesn't
    cost $2000.</p>

<p>Since a tethered robot isn't much fun, I hooked it up with Raspberry Pi and a battery in the dust-bin area to act as
    its brain, and used the Pi Camera for a live video feed. With this setup, I could access the Pi remotely over the
    internet from anywhere, give commands to drive the robot, and view the live video. Next steps could be:
<ul class="default">
    <li>Hook up to Pi to the robot's internal battery, so that it could charge itself from the charging station</li>
    <li>Make a web-interface for the remote connection</li>
    <li>Give it some autonomy to patrol the house</li>
</ul>
