<p>Building on research done by Rob Platt, I worked on identification of object handles and automatic grasping of objects. The robot <span class="define" title="Crowdsourced Autonomy and Robot Learning">CARL</span> was equipped with a 3-fingered 6-DOF JACO arm, which I used for the grasping tasks. Object handles were identified by processing pointcloud data from a Kinect mounted on CARL.</p>
