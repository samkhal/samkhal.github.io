<p>A new sensor was developed at Lincoln Lab called "Localizing Ground Penetrating Radar". In essence, it is a radar array mounted to the underside of a vehicle. As the car drives, the radar maps out the road's subsurface features, capturing man-made objects such as pipes along with rocks and soil densities. The result is a 3D voxel grid of sensor readings along the vehicle's path, approximately as wide as the vehicle itself and 2-3 meters deep. Once the map is built, it can later be used to localize the car with amazing accuracy even at highway speeds.</p>
                
<p>While the lab had achieved excellent results in localization, the existing method depended on GPS for the initial fix. My work involved developing an algorithm for performing localization in GPS-denied environments where an initial fix was not possible. Using subsurface feature-detection, efficient map representations, and IMU-based estimation of the car's motion, I was able to localize a series of ground scans across an large-scale map from just a few seconds of data. I also demonstrated that my method could be run in real-time to achieve a unique fix within the first few seconds of the car's motion. </p>
