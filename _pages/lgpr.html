<p>A new sensor was developed at Lincoln Lab called "Localizing Ground Penetrating Radar". In essence, it is a radar array mounted to the underside of a vehicle. As the car drives, the radar maps out the road's subsurface features, capturing man-made objects such as pipes along with rocks and soil densities. The result is a 3D voxel grid of sensor readings along the vehicle's path, approximately as wide as the vehicle itself and 2-3 meters deep. Once the map is built, it can later be used to localize the car with amazing accuracy even at highway speeds.</p>
                
<p>While the lab had achieved excellent results in localization, the existing method depended on GPS for the initial fix and searched in a small radius based on the previous position combined with GPS and IMU extrapolation. My contribution was to develop an algorithm for doing localization in GPS-denied environments. In short, utilizing high-speed matrix operations I was able develop an algorithm to localize a series of ground scans across an entire map. I also demonstrated that my method could be run in real-time to achieve a unique fix within a few seconds of driving. I'm currently working on publishing a paper on this method.</p>
