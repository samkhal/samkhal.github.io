<p>As part of WPI's Interactive Qualifying Project, I went off to Switzerland for a term to work on a project with a wider, interdisciplinary reach than most of my other projects. The task was broad: what can the Canton of Zurich do to meet the energy goals Switzerland has set for the year 2050?<p>
                
<p> Working with our sponsors at the <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/">Zurich University of Applied Sciences</a>, three other students from WPI and I tackled the problem and came out with a 60-page report, addressing the various targets that had been set and presenting a prototype roadmap for achieving them.
