<p>At the <a href="www.pppl.gov">Princeton Plasma Physics Lab</a>, I spent a summer trying to figure out how certain
    types of plasma behave. Specifically, we were trying to determine how dust-acoustic shockwaves propagated through
    complex plasma - that is, plasma that was made up of electrons, ions, and dust particles. The trouble was, these
    types of shockwaves are hard to induce; most of my work involved designing and running experiments to produce them.
    The experiment was enclosed in a vacuum chamber, making adjustments difficult.</p>

<p> My main contribution was the development of a mechanism for adjusting the experimental setup on the fly, without
    needing to open the vacuum chamber. This was made possible by passing a cylindrical rod through two Wilson seals on
    opposite sides of the chamber, and suspending a "nozzle" - a metal plate with a small hole - from this rod. By
    rotating the rod, the plate's height could be adjusted, allowing rapid data collection on the nozzle's effect on
    waves in the plasma</p>

<p>I also did a bunch of stuff in MATLAB to automate retrieval of data from the high-speed camera, and to automatically
    figure out wave propagation speeds from the camera images.</p>

<p> I kept a <a href="https://ppplintern.blogspot.com/">blog about my PPPL internship</a>.</p>
