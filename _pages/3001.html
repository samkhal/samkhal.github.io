<p>The arm is made of 3D-printed plastic and a couple of Pololu motors, with potentiometers and encoders for joint angle feedback and a standard gripper assembly for picking up blocks. The blocks move past the arm on a conveyor belt and are detected with a pair of IR sensors. The robot arm judges the block's speed, grabs it as it passes, and weighs it by looking at the arm's step-response for a predefined motion. Depending on the detected weight, the block is then sorted into different areas.</p>
                
<p>The robot autonomous motion was programmed in C++, with a MATLAB interface. The interface plotted data from the arm in real-time, drew a live stick-model of the robot, and allowed clicking locations in the workspace to command the robot arm to go there.</p><img src="/images/3001-arm-side.jpg" alt="2-DOF robot arm" class="p_img_detail" />
