<p>Another project I was involved in with the PA astronomy department involved the set-up of an automated meteor tracking camera on the roof of our observatory. Connected to a computer running the <a href="http://www.metrec.org/">MetRec</a> software, we were able to get nightly readings of detected meteors and meteor showers, when weather allowed. I also developed some tools to generate summaries, remove clouds and other false positives, and operate the system remotely.</p>
