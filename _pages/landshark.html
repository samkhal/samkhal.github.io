<p>At MIT Lincoln Laboratory, I was tasked with integrating their LandShark robot with <span class="define"
        title="Robot Operating System">ROS</span>, and developing code for waypoint-based patrolling using the onboard
    GPS
    and <span class="define" title="Inertial Navigation System">INS</span> systems. To this end I wrote ROS drivers to
    process the GPS and INS data, and used a pure-pursuit method for trajectory planning via provided GPS waypoints.
    This
    was all wrapped up in a graphical interface to allow clicking on a map on which the robot's calculated trajectory
    and
    waypoints would be displayed.</p>
